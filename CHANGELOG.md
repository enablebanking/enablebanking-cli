- Small fixes and improvements.

## 0.1.1 - 2024-01-10

Refreshing token on the response code 401 instead of 403 as the control panel API has changed

The very first version with minimum functionality only allowing to authenticate as a user of Enable
Banking Control Panel and register new applications.
