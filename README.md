# Enable Banking CLI

A command-line interface for Enable Banking API and its control panel

## About

The Enable Banking CLI provides developers using Enable Banking API the possibility to manage the
service from the command line or through scripts and other automation.

This project also aims to implement simple yet powerful command-line interface for accessing banking
data and initiating payments through open banking APIs integrated by Enable Banking. This functionality
is based on the [api.enablebanking.com](https://api.enablebanking.com/) aggregating Open Banking APIs
(also known as PSD2 APIs) of a large number of financial institutions in Europe.
